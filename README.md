# Epilogue

This repository show a project that, despite my best efforts, did not reach its intended functionality. We presented the work we accomplished, which, while simple, represents our journey.
Other groups implemented various design patterns, such as the Repository design pattern and interfaces, which added complexity to their projects.

Our project's simplicity belies the challenges I faced in making it operational.
Unfortunately, ``the support and effort from other team members were minimal``, which added to the difficulties I encountered.
Despite these hurdles, I believe that the process was a valuable learning experience.

Please note that this repository has been discontinued and will not receive further updates.
We appreciate your understanding and thank you for your interest in our project.
rip.
